# Named Types

> A named type is a type that can be given a particular name when itâ€™s defined. Named types include `classes`, `structures`, `enumerations`, and `protocols`.

>> For example, instances of a user-defined class named MyClass have the type MyClass. In addition to user-defined named types, the Swift standard library defines many commonly used named types, including those that represent arrays, dictionaries, and optional values.

# Compound Types

> **A compound type is a type without a name**, defined in the Swift language itself. There are two compound types: `function types` and `tuple types`.
