# What is Computer Vision?

Acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding visual data in order to produce numerical or symbolic information.[wikipedia]

# Topics in Computer Vision

- Low-level vision (early vision)
  - Image formation
  - Image filtering
  - Optical flow
  - Image segmentation
  - Stereopsis

- Mid-level
  - Object tracking
  - Human motion analysis

- High-level vision
  - Object recognition
  - Event detection
  - Scene & video understanding


# Python Image Library

- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.x/)
  - Pillow(PIL fork) provides general image handling and lots of useful basic image operations like resizing, cropping, rotating, color conversion and much more.

# Image
- Images are stored in 2D or 3D arrays.
- Images can be dealt with as a function

# What is Image Histogram?

- A histogram is a distribution of pixel values - each bin has a count of how many pixels have the value.

# What is Histogram Equalization?
- Flattens the histogram so that all intensities are as equally common as possible.

# What is Image Filtering?

- Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening, and edge enhancement.

- Application of Filtering
  - Enhance an image, e.g., denoise, resize.
  - Extract information, e.g., texture, edges.
  - Detect patterns, e.g., template matching.

# Linear Filtering

- Correlation Filtering
  - Involves weighted combinations of pixels in small neighborhoods.
  - The output pixels value is determined as a weighted sum of input pixel values
  - Filter coefficients
- Convolution Filtering
- Symmetric kernel has same results of correlation and convolution filtering.

# Separable Linear Filtering
- The process of performing a convolution requires K2 operations per pixel, where K is the size (width or height) of the convolution kernel.
- In many cases, this operation can be speed up by first performing a 1D horizontal convolution followed by a 1D vertical convolution, requiring 2K operations.
- If this is possible, then the convolution kernel is called separable.
  - **K = vh<sup>T</sup>**

Degree of Freedom

The number of independent pieces of information that go into the estimate of a parameter is called the degrees of freedom (DOF). In this guide, DOF are given for 3D images.

each of a number of independently variable factors affecting the range of states in which a system may exist, in particular.

Image Warping
- Forward Warping
- Inverse warping
- linear interpolation
- Homogeneous Coordinate


Homography Estimation
- (DLT) Direct linear transform

Robust Parameter Estimation
- RANSAC
- Estimation Refinement(개선)
- LLS
- NLS
- LM Algorithm
- Robust Least-Squares

Parameter Estimation Summary
To estimate the parameters of a model for the noisy data:
* DLT works only for noise-free data.
* Use RANSAC or similar to filter the outliers.
* Use optimization for the inliers with the RANSAC result as the initial parameter.
* Even after RANSAC filtering, using a robust norm in optimization is desired.
