# CNAME vs A Records

Last Edited: May 14, 2019 11:06 AM

`A` and `CNAME` records are for DNS records. 

## Deferences

- The `A` record maps a name to one or more IP addresses when the IP are known and stable.
- The `CNAME` record maps a name to another name. It should only be used when there are no other records on that name.
