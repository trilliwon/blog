# [How the internet works](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro#internet-works-intro)

---

## Bandwidth

- transmission capacity, measured by bitrate

## Bitrate

- the number of bits per second a system can transmit
- byte = 8bit

## Latency
- time it take for one bit to travel from sender to receiver

- download 3MB song in 3second
- 8 million bits = 1 megabyte
- bitrate = 8 Mbps

## Send

| | Pro | Con | 
|:--|:--|:--|
| Electric | cheap | Signal loss |
| Light (fiber optic cable) | Fast, No signal loss | Expensive |
| Radio | Wireless | Signal loss |

## IP address and DNS

- ISP (Internet service provider)
- Wifi - ISP - Connect all

## Protocol
- All the different devices on the Internet have unique address just a number

## IP (Internet Protocol)

- 174.129.14.120
- 1010110 10000001 00001110 01111000
- country/network.region/network/subnetwork.device

- IPv4
- IPv6

- DNS(Domain Name System)
- DNS Spoofing

---

## Packet

- Packet of information
- Many kinds of digital information can be sent with **IP Packets**
- to many bits for one packet
- Packet ( from:12.123.123.41, to: 12.312.412.23 )
	- Where it came from
	- Where it's going
- Routers act like traffic managers to keep packets moving through the network smoothly
- Cheapest : time
- often the best route for data to travel isn't the most direct

## Fault Tolerant, Reliability

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- TCP+Router system scalable
- Connect, Communicate, Collaborate

---

## HTTP and HTML

- Web Browser - url (uniform resource, locator) - server - http - 

- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

---

- GET /login -> HTML CODE
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

- Browser request several http GET request

- POST 

- COOKIES - Web Browser, remember who I am 

- Safe websites prevent snooping and tampering

- SSL : Secure Sockets Layer
- TLS : Transport Layer Security

- HTTPS : HTTP Secure

- Certificate Authorities

---

- **HTTP & DNS** manage the sending and receiving of web files (HTML, videos,...)
- **TCP/IP and Routing** break down and transport packets.
- **Wires, Cables and Wifi**, Binary sequences of 1's and 0's are sent physically through electric wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless networks.

## Encryption, Decryption

- Today's secure communications are encrypted using 256 bit keys.
- Symmetric encryption
- Asymmetric encription
- Public key cryptography is the foundation of all secure message, 

## SSL & TLS
- https public key encription

---

## Cybersecurity
- Viruses
- DDoS (Distributed Denial Of Service)
- PHISHING

## Protocol A standard procedure for defining and regulating communicatin
- TCP (Connection based protocol) three way hand sake
- UDP (Connectionless protocol)
