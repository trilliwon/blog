To write further commands, create a new command encoder.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Creating a Command Encoder Object</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Because a command encoder appends commands into a specific command buffer, you create a command encoder by requesting one from the MTLCommandBuffer object you want to use it with. Use the following MTLCommandBuffer methods to create command encoders of each type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor: method creates a MTLRenderCommandEncoder object for graphics rendering to an attachment in a MTLRenderPassDescriptor.</li>\n<li>The computeCommandEncoder method creates a MTLComputeCommandEncoder object for data-parallel computations.</li>\n<li>The blitCommandEncoder method creates a MTLBlitCommandEncoder object for memory operations.</li>\n<li>The parallelRenderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor: method creates a MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder object that enables several MTLRenderCommandEncoder objects to run on different threads while still rendering to an attachment that is specified in a shared MTLRenderPassDescriptor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Render Command Encoder</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graphics rendering can be described in terms of a rendering pass.\nA MTLRenderCommandEncoder object represents the rendering state and drawing commands associated with a single rendering pass.\nA MTLRenderCommandEncoder requires an associated MTLRenderPassDescriptor (described in Creating a Render Pass Descriptor) that includes the color, depth, and stencil attachments that serve as destinations for rendering commands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify graphics resources, such as buffer and texture objects, that contain vertex, fragment, or texture image data</li>\n<li>Specify a <code class=\"language-text\">MTLRenderPipelineState</code> object that contains compiled rendering state, including vertex and fragment shaders</li>\n<li>Specify fixed-function state, including viewport, triangle fill mode, scissor rectangle, depth and stencil tests, and other values</li>\n<li>Draw 3D primitives</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> commandEncoder <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> commandBuffer<span class=\"token operator\">?</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">makeComputeCommandEncoder</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h4>Compute Command Encoder</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For data-parallel computing, the MTLComputeCommandEncoder protocol provides methods to encode commands in the command buffer that can specify the compute function and its arguments (for example, texture, buffer, and sampler state) and dispatch the compute function for execution.</li>\n<li>To create a compute command encoder object, use the computeCommandEncoder method of MTLCommandBuffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Multiple Threads, Command Buffers, and Command Encoders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most apps use a single thread to encode the rendering commands for a single frame in a single command buffer.</li>\n<li>At the end of each frame, you commit the command buffer, which both schedules and begins command execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/MetalProgrammingGuide/Art/Cmd-Model-threads_2x.png\"></a></p>\n<h1>Resource Objects: Buffers and Textures</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Metal resource objects (MTLResource) for storing unformatted memory and formatted image data. There are two types of MTLResource objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">MTLBuffer</code> represents an allocation of unformatted memory that can contain any type of data. Buffers are often used for vertex, shader, and compute state data.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">MTLTexture</code> represents an allocation of formatted image data with a specified texture type and pixel format. Texture objects are used as source textures for vertex, fragment, or compute functions, as well as to store graphics rendering output (that is, as an attachment).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Buffers Are Typeless Allocations of Memory</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A MTLBuffer object represents an allocation of memory that can contain any type of data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Creating a Buffer Object</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The following MTLDevice methods create and return a MTLBuffer object:</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Textures Are Formatted Image Data</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A MTLTexture object represents an allocation of formatted image data that can be used as a resource for a vertex shader, fragment shader, or compute function, or as an attachment to be used as a rendering destination.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A MTLTexture object can have one of the following structures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 1D, 2D, or 3D image</li>\n<li>An array of 1D or 2D images</li>\n<li>A cube of six 2D images</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Creating a Texture Object with a Texture Descriptor</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MTLTextureDescriptor defines the properties that are used to create a MTLTexture object, including its image size (width, height, and depth), pixel format, arrangement (array or cube type) and number of mipmaps.</li>\n<li>The MTLTextureDescriptor properties are only used during the creation of a MTLTexture object. After you create a MTLTexture object, property changes in its MTLTextureDescriptor object no longer have any effect on that texture.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To create one or more textures from a descriptor:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a custom MTLTextureDescriptor object that contains texture properties that describe the texture data:</li>\n<li>Create a texture from the MTLTextureDescriptor object by calling the newTextureWithDescriptor: method of a MTLDevice object. After texture creation, call the replaceRegion:mipmapLevel:slice:withBytes:bytesPerRow:bytesPerImage: method to load the texture image data.</li>\n<li>To create more MTLTexture objects, you can reuse the same MTLTextureDescriptor object, modifying the descriptor’s property values as needed.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Working with Texture Slices</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A slice is a single 1D, 2D, or 3D texture image and all its associated mipmaps. For each slice:</li>\n<li>All texture objects have at least one slice; cube and array texture types may have several slices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pixel Formats for Textures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MTLPixelFormat specifies the organization of color, depth, and stencil data storage in individual pixels of a MTLTexture object. There are three varieties of pixel formats: ordinary, packed, and compressed.</li>\n<li>For example, MTLPixelFormatRGBA8Unorm is a 32-bit format with eight bits for each color component; the lowest addresses contains red,</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Creating a Sampler States Object for Texture Lookup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code class=\"language-text\">MTLSamplerState</code> object defines the addressing, filtering, and other properties that are used when a graphics or compute function performs texture sampling operations on a <code class=\"language-text\">MTLTexture</code> object.</li>\n</ul>\n<div
