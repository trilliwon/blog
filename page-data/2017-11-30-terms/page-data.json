For example, in the case of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf”, the condition tested for was “is there a wolf near the herd?”; the shepherd at first wrongly indicated there was one, by calling “Wolf, wolf!”\nA false positive error is a type I error where the test is checking a single condition, and wrongly gives an affirmative (positive) decision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>False Negative</h1>\n<h4>실제 참인것을 거짓인 것으로 판정하는 오류</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A false negative error</strong>, or in short a false negative, is a test result that indicates that a condition does not hold, while in fact it does. I.e., erroneously no effect has been inferred. An example is a truly guilty prisoner who is acquitted of a crime. The condition “the prisoner is guilty” holds (the prisoner is guilty). But the test (a trial in a court of law) failed to realize this, and wrongly decided the prisoner was not guilty, falsely concluding a negative about the condition.\nA false negative error is a type II error occurring in a test where a single condition is checked for and the result of the test is erroneously that the condition is absent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Canonical and Non-Canonical</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In programming, canonical means “according to the rules.” And non-canonical means “not according to the rules.” In the early Christian church, the “canon” was the officially chosen text. In The New Hacker’s Dictionary , Eric Raymond tells us that the word meant “reed” in its Greek and Latin origin, and a certain length of reed came to be used as a standard measure. In some knowledge areas, such as music and literature, the “canon” is the body of work that everyone studies.\nThe terms are sometimes used to distinguish whether a programming interface follows a particular standard or precedent or whether it departs from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>BLOB</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Binary Large Object</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>W.L.O.G.</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without Loss Of Generality(일반성을 잃지 않고)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Turing Halting Problem</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>boilerplate code (판에 박힌 코드)</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>꼭 필요하지만 간단한 기능을 위해서 작성해야 하는 코드, ex) func getCurrentTime()</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Terms","date":"November 30, 2017","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-11-30-terms/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-11-23-how-to-study/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to study"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/topics/2017-12-06-computer-vision/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Computer Vision"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["240262808","2841359383"]}
